# What and Where Are the World's Oldest Businesses?
<!-- --- -->
Use SQL data manipulation and joins to discover the oldest businesses around the world.

## Project Description
---

An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the company survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this really well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored the data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when they were founded and which industries they belong to.

## This Projects solves the following tasks:
1. _**The oldest business in the world**_
2. _**How many businesses were founded before 1000?**_
3. _**Which businesses were founded before 1000?**_
4. _**Exploring the categories**_
5. _**Counting the categories**_
6. _**Oldest business by continent**_
7. _**Joining everything for further analysis**_
8. _**Counting categories by continent**_
9. _**Filtering counts by continent and category**_

### The Jupyter notebook contains the answer (code) for all of the above tasks:
